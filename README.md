# HuBot: A Biomimicking Mobile Robot for Non-Disruptive Bird Behavior Study

Welcome to the official repository for **HuBot**, a biomimetic mobile robot designed for non-invasive wildlife monitoring and ecological research. This repository hosts the dataset, methodologies, results, and code associated with the HuBot project.

## Overview

The **Houbara bustard** is a critically endangered bird species that poses challenges for traditional research due to its elusive nature and sensitivity to human disturbances. To overcome these limitations, we introduce **HuBot**, a biomimetic robot designed to seamlessly integrate into the Houbara's natural habitat. Leveraging cutting-edge object detection algorithms and robust hardware, HuBot enables unprecedented insights into the Houbara's movement patterns, social interactions, and habitat use.

## Code Examples

### **Object Detection**
```python
from torchvision.models.detection import fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn
import torchvision.transforms as T
from PIL import Image

# Load the model
model = fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Load and preprocess the image
image = Image.open("data/input/example.jpg").convert("RGB")
transform = T.Compose([T.ToTensor()])
input_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)

# Perform detection
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_tensor)

# Print detections
for box, score in zip(outputs[0]['boxes'], outputs[0]['scores']):
    if score > 0.8:  # Threshold
        print(f"Box: {box.numpy()}, Score: {score.numpy()}")
```

### **Semantic Segmentation**
```python
from torchvision.models.segmentation import deeplabv3_resnet50
import torchvision.transforms.functional as F
from PIL import Image

# Load the model
model = deeplabv3_resnet50(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Load the image
image = Image.open("data/input/example.jpg").convert("RGB")
input_tensor = F.to_tensor(image).unsqueeze(0)

# Perform segmentation
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(input_tensor)["out"][0]
    mask = output.argmax(0).byte().cpu().numpy()

# Save the segmentation mask
Image.fromarray(mask * 255).save("data/output/mask.png")

```
